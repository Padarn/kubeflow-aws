# kubeflow-aws

This is a repo to hold kustomize manifest to deploy [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) on AWS (w/o using ksonnet or kfctl) - in particular, [kubeflow pipelines (kfp)](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines).

You can use this repo as a reference to configure Kubeflow for AWS. Feel free to contribute.

> **NOTE:** These manifest are community supported, and may not be up-to-date with the latest kubeflow releases (best effort). This is not an official product by Kubeflow or Google.
